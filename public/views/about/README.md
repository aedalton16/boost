Sample Problem

Objective: A doctor often needs to search for a given diagnosis, whether using a portion of the diagnosis name as the query, or with words describing the desired diagnosis. The goal is to take the doctor query and return the best possible subset of diagnoses that match the search query. Simple examples:
- flu -> {influenza}
- heada -> {headache, cluster headache}

Constraints:
- Time: Try not to spend more than a couple of hours!
- Programming language: Preferably Python, but feel free to use whatever you are most comfortable with.

Notes:
- The problem is intentionally amorphous and broad in its scope. Ultimately, the notion of what is the best subset of matching diagnoses can be quite subjective; we leave it up to you to determine the metrics you want to use.
- You should aim to approach this problem first from the thought and architectural perspectives, then work your way backwards and do what you can in the given time constraint.
- We suggest first implementing a simple diagnosis name string matching algorithm, and going from there.
- If you want to implement this as a web service or site, even better.
- A list of sample diagnosis strings are attached.

Engineering Principles to keep in mind:
- Simple. As simple as possible, but no simpler.
- Prescient. Anticipates future needs.
- Flexible. Separable and replaceable code.
- Intuitive. Good naming conventions, well-scoped methods, clear documentation describing implementation details, etc.

Deliverables:
- Some working (or not) implementation.
- Writeup detailing: 
    - Your approach, tradeoffs, and expected outcomes.
    - Tools and other technologies you would use and/or investigate.
    - Your evaluation criteria.
    - How much time would you want to accomplish this? What if you had a time constraint of 1 week, 1 month, or 4 months?
